## Elemental Properties
This script provides the user with elemental properties such as atomic symbol, atomic mass, melting point, and boiling point. The user inputs the name of the element or its atomic number (only elements with atomic numbers in the range 1-10 are available) and the script returns the properties for that element.
This project was one of the many projects completed to earn the [freeCodeCamp.org Relational Database Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database)
